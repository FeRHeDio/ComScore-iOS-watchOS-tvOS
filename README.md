Usage
=====

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

Installation
============

The comScore Analytics SDK can be installed in several ways.

CocoaPods
---------

comScore Analytics is also available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). The podspec supports iOS, watchOS & tvOS devices only. 

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "ComScore"
```

Carthage
--------

For projects targeting iOS 8 and above, the comScore Analytics SDK can be installed using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) by simply adding the associated dependency to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "comScore/ComScore-iOS-watchOS-tvOS"
```

Then run `carthage update` to update the dependencies. Unlike CocoaPods, your project is not changed. You will need to manually add the `.framework` generated in the `Carthage/Build/iOS` folder to your projet. Refer to the [official Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for more information.

Manual
------

Refer to the implementation guides for information on how to manually add the framework to your project.
